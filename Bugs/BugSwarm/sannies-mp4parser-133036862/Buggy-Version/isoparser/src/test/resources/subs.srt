1
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:15,727
I have to go home.

2
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,324
My mother will kill me.

3
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:18,661
No.

4
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:22,131
Stay with me tonight.

5
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,371
Roman wants us to
be there at 9am.

6
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:27,834
Raya, we talked about this.

7
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:31,240
It's just a few months
working in a hotel.

8
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:32,149
Yes, but-

9
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:35,084
Do you want to work at the
printers, like your mother?

10
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,817
He said it was the two of us,
or nothing.

11
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:48,257
No.

12
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:57,398
Fuck your mother.

13
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:17,695
Sorry.

14
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:18,992
It's 1:30 in the morning.

15
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:20,631
You don't understand;
Luba wanted me-

16
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:24,499
If her mother lets her do what
she wants, go live there.

17
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:26,727
You've graduated.

18
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:28,063
You're an adult now.

19
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:31,868
Do what you want.

20
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,340
Big smile.

21
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:19,244
Big smile.

22
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:23,624
Good.
What will you say at the border?

23
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,633
I'm Natalya.

24
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,464
I'm Natalya Verbova.

25
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:36,373
I'm going to Budapest
to buy rugs to resell.

26
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:37,340
Raya.

27
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,466
Hello.

28
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,006
I'm working.

29
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:43,044
Leave. Leave.

30
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,583
Leave.

31
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:45,153
Cross-referencing
of each lesion

32
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:48,091
with other cases,

33
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,615
the courts considered
serious assault.

34
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,595
If the court decides

35
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:55,155
that to stab a man
in a bar is a crime,

36
00:17:56,166 --> 00:18:00,865
the same should apply
to a woman at home.

37
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:09,635
I have considered the
evidence, and hereby find

38
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:11,839
in favor of Zlata Sehik.

39
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,391
Raya, are you okay?

40
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:37,759
It's me, Irka. Wake up.

41
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:43,856
Hello?

42
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,501
I'm calling from the Global
Displacement Agency

43
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:47,593
in Sarajevo.

44
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:49,830
Do you have a daughter
named Raya?

45
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:50,933
Yes, yes.

46
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:53,068
She is here.

47
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:55,439
If everything checks out,

48
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,841
we will send her home
in a few days.

49
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,340
I will come there now.

50
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:01,349
I'm sorry, but we can't
afford that.

51
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:04,284
I will pay. Just tell
me where to go.

52
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,456
Roman will be back soon.

53
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:23,767
He seems to be doing well.

54
00:46:24,706 --> 00:46:25,536
Milk?

55
00:46:26,908 --> 00:46:28,637
I need to borrow money.

56
00:46:35,216 --> 00:46:37,650
They found Raya
in Sarajevo.

57
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:40,180
I need to go get her.

58
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,716
I don't need much.

59
00:46:50,832 --> 00:46:51,924
Did he beat you?

60
00:47:03,678 --> 00:47:05,737
You know I hate to ask,

61
00:47:07,448 --> 00:47:09,006
but she is my daughter,

62
00:47:11,152 --> 00:47:13,086
and his niece. Please.

63
00:47:18,426 --> 00:47:19,825
I will get the money.

64
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:24,521
But you have to go.
Roman will be back soon.

65
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,558
He won't give me the money
if he knows it's for you.

66
00:53:23,925 --> 00:53:25,290
Where's the other?

67
00:53:25,693 --> 00:53:27,092
Where's the other?

68
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,197
She's not here. Let's go!

69
00:53:47,215 --> 00:53:50,651
We will do everything
to bring back Raya.

70
00:53:55,256 --> 00:53:56,689
I'm so sorry.

71
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:14,172
What will they do to her?

72
00:54:18,145 --> 00:54:20,613
What will they do to her?

73
00:54:43,337 --> 00:54:48,001
I want to show you what happens
when you talk to the devil.

74
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:50,177
Now. Bring it.

75
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:10,328
Watch. Make sure they see.

76
00:55:17,405 --> 00:55:19,236
Open your eyes.

77
00:56:06,987 --> 00:56:08,614
Look at it.

78
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,883
You see your friend now!

79
01:04:51,411 --> 01:04:54,346
You start work in 2 hours.

80
01:05:08,795 --> 01:05:11,423
Come sleep on the free
part of the mattress.

81
01:05:13,934 --> 01:05:15,367
They bring food in the morning.

82
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:18,404
You have to eat everything,
or pay a fine.

83
01:05:21,608 --> 01:05:22,370
Come, sit down.

84
01:05:31,251 --> 01:05:33,116
You don't look very well.

85
01:05:36,957 --> 01:05:38,322
What's your name?

86
01:05:40,127 --> 01:05:43,096
Raya Kochan.

87
01:05:49,503 --> 01:05:54,998
I've almost paid my dues.
Then I can go home.

88
01:05:56,777 --> 01:05:59,211
- It's all lies.
- No.

89
01:06:00,714 --> 01:06:03,274
He returned a girl
after three months.

90
01:06:04,017 --> 01:06:04,881
I was here.

91
01:06:07,688 --> 01:06:08,677
What is your name?

92
01:06:13,327 --> 01:06:15,727
I'm Luba. Luba Pallch.

93
01:06:25,505 --> 01:06:29,271
I'm afraid we cannot keep
you here any longer.

94
01:06:31,878 --> 01:06:35,006
We'll let you know if
something comes up.

95
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,947
We will do everything
to bring back Raya.

96
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:49,726
What is this?

97
01:15:52,038 --> 01:15:53,733
- We have to leave.
- No.

98
01:15:54,607 --> 01:15:56,472
You're creating problems.

99
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:00,907
Go.

100
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:33,113
I wanted to tell you.

101
01:25:41,327 --> 01:25:43,158
She's how you paid for it.

102
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:48,427
Roman. He does...

103
01:25:52,004 --> 01:25:53,403
How could you...

104
01:25:57,409 --> 01:25:59,570
sell your own blood?

105
01:26:03,883 --> 01:26:05,282
He's crazy.

106
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:10,179
He's crazy.

107
01:26:15,094 --> 01:26:16,459
He's crazy.

108
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:22,196
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

109
01:26:22,968 --> 01:26:24,737
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

110
01:26:24,737 --> 01:26:25,829
Where is she?

111
01:26:27,273 --> 01:26:30,106
Where is she?
Where is she?

112
01:26:30,276 --> 01:26:34,042
Where is she?
Where is she?

113
01:26:40,419 --> 01:26:41,852
She is no longer your sister.

114
01:26:43,889 --> 01:26:45,880
Stay away from here.

115
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:13,419
Where is Raya, that little bitch?

116
01:27:13,419 --> 01:27:17,378
She's in the back.

117
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:23,390
I said nothing!

118
01:27:37,977 --> 01:27:39,467
No!

119
01:27:43,882 --> 01:27:46,578
I said nothing!

120
01:27:55,527 --> 01:27:57,757
Please!
