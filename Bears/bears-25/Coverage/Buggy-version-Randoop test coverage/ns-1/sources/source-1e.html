&nbsp;     * and NOT Object Id; naming of this feature is somewhat confusing, so it is important
&nbsp;     * that Object &lt;b&gt;for which identity is to be preserved&lt;/b&gt; are considered equal,
&nbsp;     * above and beyond ids (which are always compared using equality anyway).
&nbsp;     *&lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * NOTE: due to the way functionality is implemented, it is very important that
&nbsp;     * in addition to overriding {@link Object#equals} for Objects to match (to be considered
&nbsp;     * &quot;same&quot;) it is also necessary to ensure that {@link Object#hashCode()} is overridden
&nbsp;     * to produce the exact same value for equal instances.
&nbsp;     *&lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * Feature is disabled by default; meaning that strict identity is used, not
&nbsp;     * &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;
&nbsp;     *
